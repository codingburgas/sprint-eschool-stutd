## About 📖
<p>[Your project description here]</p>

## Project Goal 🎯
<p>Our mission is to make last-minute test preparation easier and more effective with interactive literature quizzes! 📚✨ As students, we understand that many of our peers only start studying the night before a test. This often makes it hard to grasp all the important lessons and concepts.</p>

<p>With this project, we aim to provide quick, engaging tests about the books and authors we study, helping students reinforce their knowledge—even when time is short! ⏳💡</p>

<p>Our goal is to make learning just before a test more effective with literature quizzes about the books and writers we learn about. As students, we know that most pupils only study right before the day of the test. This often makes it difficult to learn all the lessons and concepts. Our interactive quizzes are designed to help bridge that gap and make last-minute studying more productive and fun!</p>
